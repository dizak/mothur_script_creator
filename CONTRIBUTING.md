Below you can find description of mothulity structure and contribution guidelines.

## mothulity flow

The phylosophy behind mothulity is simple:

1. gather all the info from the user with a short one-liner.

2. run Mothur

3. gather the Mothur's output and generate an elegant HTML report.

## Branch names

The branch names **must** be named after issues so they **must** contain the corresponding issue number.
There are two options:

- name-of-issue#number-of-issue

- label-of-issue#number-of-issue

For instance: no-email-notification#13 or cleaner-code-in-decision-tree#17 or bug#42

## Installation for development

mothulity is meant to be used after installation with pip. For local development, please add /path/to/mothulity-scripts/ and /path/to/mothulity/embedded/executables to your $PATH
